    <p>
        At max_ray_depth = 0, we only see the light source.
        At max_ray_depth = 1, we can see the walls and the parts of the floor that aren't directly shaded by the spheres.
        At max_ray_depth = 2, we see illumination in the top ceiling and reflection of the walls and floor in the spheres. Shadows of the spheres become less dark.
        At max_ray_depth = 3, the room becomes even brighter. The ceiling is now seen in the reflection of the spheres. The illumination of light at the center of the closer ball's shadow also appears.
        At max_ray_depth = 4, the slight illumination of light on the blue wall from the sphere can be seen.
        At max_ray_depth = 5 and 100, the images seem to stay relatively similar to max_ray_depth = 4.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        At max_ray_depth = 0, there is no bouncing of rays, so the only illumination in the image is the light, which generates rays directly to the camera.
        At max_ray_depth = 1, there is one bounce, so we can see the walls and the parts of the floor that aren't directly shaded by the spheres. The ray bounces from the light to the walls to the camera, resulting in more illuminated areas.
        At max_ray_depth = 2, there are two bounces. We see illumination in the top ceiling as light can bounce from one wall (or the sphere) to the top ceiling. Light can also bounce from the spheres to the wall and then to the camera, resulting in reflection of the walls and floor in the spheres. Shadows of the spheres become less dark as light bounces towards it off other surfaces.
        At max_ray_depth = 3, there are three bounces and the room becomes even brighter as light reaches areas in the corner of the room it couldn't reach before. The ceiling is now seen in the reflection of the spheres, since light can bounce off the spheres to the wall to the ceiling and then to the camera. The illumination of light at the center of the closer ball's  shadow also appears as the glass material focuses rays towards that spot.
        At max_ray_depth = 4, there are four bounces, as the slight illumination of light on the blue wall from the sphere is seen, as rays are allowed to bounce and refract within the spheres and focus on that one spot on the wall.
        At max_ray_depth = 5 and 100, the images seem to stay relatively similar to max_ray_depth = 4, as all areas of the room that would be illuminated by the light ray before its luminance falls off with distance has already been illuminated.

        The difference between these four images is the roughness of the macro surface, which is associated with alpha value.
        The smaller the alpha value, the smoother the surface will be, which means that the surface will appear smoother and glossier.
